# BookSwap App
Mobile Systems and Aplications - group project - 2024

# 1. Project Proposal
Many people have lots of books at home, and for the avid readers, many books sit on the shelf, gathering dust, after being read. Some people even keep loads of very old books, because they have nothing else to do with them.

On our book swap app, the user would be able to swap a book already read with a new book from another user so each of them will have a new, but used, book to read. On the app the user would have an account in which he/she/they could upload the books that they already read or simply don’t want anymore and search in other users’ a book they would like a swap with or wait for a swap offer, decide and then enjoy a new reading adventure.

It will benefit the avid readers who don’t want to keep the books they already read, don’t want to give the money for new books and also don’t want to be rushed in reading a book like in a library.

For technologies we will use Visual Studio Code with Angular for front-end, with Django and AWS for back-end, PostgreSQL for database.

As a plan, we would first have a meeting in which each of us would say what we want from each others part, have meeting once a week to see what we did, if it’s ok to add to the project. By week 6 we would like to have the basic things functional, by week 8 for all our functions to work as talked and afterwards to debate on what needs to be change in the aspect of the project, or the overall design.

# 2. Requirements Gathering
The app will have a log in and register pages, in which the user would use their preferred email and a password, will have a scroll page in which the user will see the available books for trade and where he can make an offer for one, a message page where the user will see their conversations with other users about the offer and a profile page where the user will see the books they uploaded and they overall description.

When an user will make an offer for a book, the other user would get a notification and enter the message page where he could talk to the other user, see their offer and accept or decline.
