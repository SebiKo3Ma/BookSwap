    <p>
      We aim for books to be cherished as much as possible. We care about ecology and believe that using second-hand books is beneficial.
      We want everyone to have access to reading without spending too much money.

      We are Lorena and Sebi, fourth-year students at the Politehnica University of Timi»ôoara. Our love for reading, concern for nature, and worries about the national economic situation inspired us to create this project.
